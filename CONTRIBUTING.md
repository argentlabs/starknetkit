# Starknetkit Contribution Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to Starknetkit!

We love pull requests and this guide aims to provide an overview of the contribution workflow to help us make the contribution process effective for everyone involved.

If you want to contribute but don’t know what to do, take a look at issues labelled `good first issue`.

## Getting started

You can contribute to this repo in many ways:

- Solve open issues
- Report bugs or feature requests
- Add new features such as new connectors
- Improve the documentation

Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines for contributions:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- If you're running into an error, please give context. Explain what you're trying to do and how to reproduce the error.
- Please use the same formatting in the code repository. You can configure your IDE to do it by using the prettier / linting config files included in each package.
- If applicable, please edit the README.md file to reflect the changes.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you.

If a contributor is working on the issue, they will be assigned to the individual. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to assign it to yourself and open a PR with a fix for it.

### Pull Requests

#### Pull Request Process

We follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the project
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name
4. Commit your changes to the new branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and tag one of the maintainers to review your PR

Here are some tips for a high-quality pull request:

- Create a title for the PR that accurately defines the work done.
- Structure the description neatly to make it easy to consume by the readers. For example, you can include bullet points and screenshots instead of having one large paragraph.
- Add the link to the issue if applicable.
- Have a good commit message that summarises the work done.

Once you submit your PR:

- We may ask questions, request additional information or ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. Please note that these are to make the PR clear for everyone involved and aims to create a frictionless interaction process.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation resolved.
- Once approved, your PR will be merged.

#### Pull request targets

For the most common pull requests such as bug fixes, feature additions, documentation changes, etc., target the develop branch.

### Other notes

- If you have commit access to the repository and want to make a big change or are unsure about something, make a new branch and open a pull request.
- We’re using Prettier to format code, so don’t worry much about code formatting.
- Don’t commit generated files, like minified JavaScript.
- Don’t change the version number or changelog.

### Need help?

If you want to contribute but have any questions, concerns or doubts, feel free to ping maintainers. Ideally create a pull request with WIP (Work in progress) in its title and ask questions in the pull request description.
